20 points

  Assignment Description.

Answer the following questions from the Chapter 3 reading from 
your textbook. Be through and complete with your answers. You may 
work on these questions with a partner (no more than two working 
together), but both students must submit the document 
individually on Beachboard Dropbox along with both studentsâ€™ 
names on each submission.

1. Statically associating only a single thread with a lightweight 
  process is not such a good idea. Why not? 

2. Having only a single lightweight process per process is also 
  not such a good idea. Why not? 

3. Describe a simple scheme in which there are as many 
  lightweight processes as there are runnable threads. 

4. Constructing a concurrent server by spawning a process has 
  some advantages and disadvantages compared to multithreaded 
  servers. Discuss a few. 

5. How can we prevent an application from circumventing a window 
  manager, and thus being able to completely mess up a screen? 

6. Is a server that maintains a TCP/IP connection to a client 
  stateful or stateless? Why? 

7. Imagine a Web server that maintains a table in which client IP 
  addresses are mapped to the most recently accessed Web pages. 
  When a client connects to the server, the server looks up the 
  client in its table, and if found, returns the registered page. 
  Is this server stateful or stateless? 

8. Consider a process P that requires access to file F which is 
  locally available on the machine where P is currently running. 
  When P moves to another machine, it still requires access to F. 
  If the file-to-machine binding is fixed, how could the 
  systemwide reference to F be implemented? 

9. Describe in detail how TCP packets flow in the case of TCP 
  handoff, along with the information on source and destination 
  addresses in the various headers. 

10. Strong mobility in UNIX systems could be supported by 
  allowing a process to fork a child on a remote machine. Explain 
  how this would work.
